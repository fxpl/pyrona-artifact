"""User-facing immutability helpers.

This module re-exports the public API from the internal C extension
`_immutable`, keeping the programmer-facing surface in Python.

Immutability comes in two depths.  A *shallow* frozen object cannot have
its own state mutated, but the objects it references may still be
mutable.  A *deeply* frozen object is shallow frozen and so is everything
reachable from it; only deeply frozen objects can be shared between
interpreters.

Freezing is one-way: there is no unfreeze.  It is also not atomic.
deep_freeze() shallow freezes objects as it walks the graph, so if it
fails part way through, any subset of the objects it reached may be left
shallow frozen, and they stay that way.  Nothing is deep frozen unless
the whole call succeeds.

On failure a TypeError is raised with the object that could not be frozen
attached to it::

    try:
        deep_freeze(obj)
    except TypeError as err:
        print("could not freeze", err.obj)

Once that object is dealt with, calling deep_freeze() again will finish
the job.

class FreezabilityOverride:
    """Context manager to temporarily override an object's freezability.

    On entry, saves the object's current effective freezability (which may
    be inherited from the type) and applies the requested override.
    On exit, restores the saved status via set_freezable().

    Design note: on exit we always call set_freezable() with the value
    that get_freezable() returned on entry, even if that value was
    inherited from the type rather than set directly on the object.
    This means the context manager may leave a per-object status where
    none existed before.  We considered two alternatives:

      * "Best-effort unset": use a get_direct_freezable() that inspects
        only the object's own __dict__ / ob_flags, and call
        unset_freezable() when no direct status existed.  This mostly
        works, but C types with custom tp_getattro cannot reliably
        distinguish per-object from inherited status, so the "direct"
        check is incomplete for some extension types.

      * "No-effort unset" (chosen): always snapshot the effective status
        and restore it with set_freezable().  Simple, correct for all
        object kinds, and predictable.  The trade-off is that after the
        context manager exits, the object will have an explicit
        per-object status even if it previously relied on inheritance.

    Usage:
        with FreezabilityOverride(obj, FREEZABLE_NO):
            # obj is temporarily not freezable
            ...
        # obj's original effective freezability is restored
